# Custom Windows batch code to intiate and run a Spigot powered Minecraft server!
This code is still very experimental and does not always start every world and may start the same world continuously. Worlds can be disable/ uploaded by adding a "-" to the start of the folder name for each world. Re-enabling a world is as simple as removing the "-" and restarting the server.
